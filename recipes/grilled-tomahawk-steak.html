        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This grilled tomahawk steak recipe is a showstopper, ideal for sharing with friends and family. This reverse-seared steak is cooked to perfection with an unctuous compound butter filled with shallots, garlic, and chives.</p>
        <p>I like to use a Bluetooth-enabled meat thermometer to help me achieve the perfect medium-rare internal temperature.</p>
