        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pour bread flour into the bowl of an electric stand mixer and add water, followed by salt. 
                Sprinkle yeast over the surface and allow to dissolve, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Mix on medium speed using the paddle attachment until the dough comes together.
                Replace the paddle with a dough hook. Continue mixing until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow to the dough to rise to about twice its size, 30 to 45 minutes.
                Push a finger into the dough. The dough should give some resistance, but not spring back. 
                If it springs back, let it rise longer.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Turn dough out onto a floured surface and punch down to expel excess gas and redistribute the yeast.
                Cover with a clean dish towel and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Shape the dough into a boule by pushing back and forth on the counter in a circular motion until you have a round, smooth ball.
                Cover dough with a clean dish towel and allow to rise, about 1 hour.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a Dutch oven.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Slice a very shallow "X" into the top of the bread with a sharp knife to help it expand while baking.
                Place loaf into the prepared Dutch oven and cover with the lid.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and continue to bake, covered, for 20 minutes.
                Remove the lid and continue baking until deep golden, 25 to 30 minutes.
            </li>
