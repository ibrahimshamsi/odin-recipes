# odin-recipes
A simple website that displays recipes; a showcase of foundational html concepts taught in the "The Odin Project" self study course.

This project is a simple website consisting of a home page and multiple recipe pages. It is a showcase of basic html concepts and techniques as well as git convention and usage (hopefully).

Upon completion it will demonstrate basic html knowledge of the following:

- boilerplate set up
- elements and tags
- working with text (paragraphs, strong/em)
- ordered/unordered lists
- links and images

Additionally, it will also demonstrate knowledge and proper usage of git and the basic git workflow:

- git add/commit cycle
- writing effective git commit messages (there was an attempt)
